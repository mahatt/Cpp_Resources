## Compiling Pass

* Make Sure llvm/tools are in PATH Needed clang,llvm-config,opt
* In Quadric Directory, do Make which generates LoopMetadata.so


## Running Pass
* switch to tests
* runpass.sh <src_file>.cpp
* generate Transformed ll file.


## Good Testing Practise with LLVM
* Using File Check test to clearly check transform intented and transform performed.
